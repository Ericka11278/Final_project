# Final_project
Purpose of each file in the repository:
- The finalproject.py file contains the program and the ‘inventory.csv’ file contains the numbers on available stock and the price to rent it.

How to run the program from the command line:
- To run the program from the command line, type ‘python3 finalproject.py’ or for a Windows user, ‘python finalproject.py’ in the terminal.

How to use the program:
- The program will prompt you to input your name and phone number, then a list of options will be displayed. It will prompt you to input a number corresponding to a   request from the list of options. Interpret the data based on what you requested, so if you requested to display the available inventory, it will display the      available inventory and so on.

 The following sources were used to assist in the development of my code. The firts source was used determine how long an item was rented out for based on when it is being returend (now) in comparsion to when it was rented out and how long it was orriginally planned to be rented out for. I used the second source to get  better understanding of reading a csv file and getting certain parts of a csv file to work within different parts of my code.

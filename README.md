Purpose of each file in the repository:

How to run the program from the command line:
To run the program from the command line, type ‘python3 finalproject.py’ or for a Windows user, ‘python finalproject.py’
How to use the program:
The program will prompt you to input your name and phone number, then a list of options will be displayed. It will prompt you to input a number corresponding to a request from the list of options. Interpret the data based on what you requested, so if you requested to display the available inventory, it will display the available inventory and so on.

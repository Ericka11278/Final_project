#As a group one of our ideas was to make a type of rental where a user will be 
#prompted to enter the time they want to rent "product" and then this will 
#make their time run through and based on the time they have inputed, they will 
# be given an amount they have to pay that correspoinds with said time.
# Rental ideas as of now: car rentals, calculator rentas, beach umbrella rentals...etc
# My idea is a laptop rental














#We mainly want to center our idea on a subscription platform of some sort theres still more ideas we can come up with
# like a companion app that reminds you to do things, or maybe even an app for students in college who want to do laundry that notifies them what
# laundry machine is not being used or other things 
# We could also create an app that lets you sync your youtube playlist to your spotify playlist or vice versa#

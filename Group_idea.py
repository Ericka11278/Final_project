#As a group one of our ideas was to make a type of rental where a user will be 
#prompted to enter the time they want to rent "product" and then this will 
#make their time run through and based on the time they have inputed, they will 
# be given an amount they have to pay that correspoinds with said time.
# Rental ideas as of now: car rentals, calculator rentas, beach umbrella rentals...etc
